# simple-react-chat
Simple node chat app using react and socket.io. To run local, change dir to the server "cd .\server\\" and run "npm start". To run client "cd .\client\\" and run "npm run dev". Used this to learn socket.io so I can implement it in my kickThis app so users can communicate with each other. As always look both ways and watch out for motorcycles.
